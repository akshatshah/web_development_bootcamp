# CSS Syntax
- Syntax is the "grammar" of a language

        selector{property:value;}
- selector comes at the beginning of a CSS rule 
- The rules reside inside the curly braces.
- The rules give a new value to a property.
- Each rule has to end with a ;
- Selector: Who do you want to change?
- Property: What do you want to change?
- Value: How do you want to change the property?
- All properties in alphabetical order (best practice)
