# The Internet

## What's the internet?

- Long piece of wire connecting different computters
- Servers: Computers that are online 24/7 that serve all the data
- Client: Computers that users use to access the  internet

## How do we locate the correct data?

- Your browser would send a message to your ISP (Internet Service Provider)
- ISP would relay that message to a DNS (Domain Name System ) server
- DNS is essentially a phone book for the internet
- DNS would look at the exact IP address of the website  we are trying to access
- DNS server sends back the IP adress to the computer
