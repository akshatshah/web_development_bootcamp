# CSS static and relative positioning
- Even without CSS. Html has predefined rules for element positioning.
- Rules  
    1. Content is everything. Inline elements only take up as much space as the content. For block elements, the content determines the height.
    2. Order comes the HTML
    3. Children sit on top of parents

## Position
- Static
    - All HTML elements are static by default
- Relative
    - Position the selected element relative to its static position
    - Coordinates
        - left
        - top
        - bottom
        - right

    - Doesn't affect the position of anything else on the screen

- Absolute
    - Positioning the element relative to its parent
    - Does affect the flow of the other elements

- Fixed
    - Does not move at all
