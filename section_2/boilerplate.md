# What is HTML boilerplate?

- A code template that we can reuse
- Latest version of the HTML is HTML5
- Doctype tells the browser how to render the file

## Example
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <title> Boilerplate </title>
        </head> 
        <body>
        
        </body>
    </html>

- \<html> \</html> tags tell the browser everything in between them is html
- The information between these tags consists of a head  and a body
- Head is the part of the html that holds information about the webpage and tells the browser how it should handle the page
- The meta elements give extra associated data to the browser and search engines
- utf-8 is the standard encoding
